Beneath the moon of silver flame,
The dragon dreams and speaks my name.
Through forests deep where shadows glide,
I chase the truth the stars still hide.

The winds of fate begin to turn,
With ancient runes that start to burn.
A crown of thorns, a blade of light,
Shall guide me through the endless night.

The night is thick with whispered dread,
Each step I take, by shadows led.
A thousand trials bar my way,
Yet still I rise, I will not sway.
